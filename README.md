# What is TazUO?
**TazUO** was originally a fork from ClassicUO with the mindset of adding features requested by users to improve QOL. **TazUO** has since moved away from ClassicUO, we will keep an eye on ClassicUO updates and incorporate changes or fixes as they have a wider user base that provides bug reports, but **TazUO** will no longer be merging all changes from ClassicUO.

# Play now
The easiest way to play with TazUO is via our [launcher](https://github.com/bittiez/TUO-Launcher/releases/latest)!
