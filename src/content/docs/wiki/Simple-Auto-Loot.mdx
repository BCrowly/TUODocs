TazUO has a built in simple auto loot feature.  
Easily loot items by graphic and hue(color) automatically from corpses.  
`Options->TazUO->AutoLoot`

## Features
- Easily add items to your loot list by `Shift + Clicking` the item in a grid container.  
- Auto duplicate checks.  
- Easy to edit JSON save file if desired.  

Items are looted based on `graphic`(the first number) and `hue`(the second number).  
If `hue` is set to `-1`, `hue` will be ignored and only `graphic` will be checked.  
You can also **optionally** use regex to for matching. This is more technical and [regex101](https://regex101.com/) will be your friend.
