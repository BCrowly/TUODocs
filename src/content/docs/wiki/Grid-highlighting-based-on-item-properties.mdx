# Detail explanation:
## Grid Highlight System

The Grid Highlight system allows you to visually highlight items in grid containers based on customizable matching rules. It is useful for quickly identifying valuable, rare, or unwanted items in loot or inventory grids.
## Overview

Each highlight rule defines a configuration that matches certain item properties and assigns a hue (color) to highlight matching items. Multiple rules can be configured, and each rule is editable from the in-game Grid Highlight Menu.

## Core Features
### Match by Properties

You can define any number of item property names that a rule should match. These properties are based on tooltip attributes like:

    "Hit Chance Increase"

    "Faster Casting"

    "Swing Speed Increase"

Each property can have an optional minimum value threshold.

    Example:
    "Swing Speed Increase" ≥ 10

### Accept Extra Properties

The Allow Extra Properties toggle determines whether the item is allowed to have additional properties beyond the ones listed.

    ✅ On: Item must match your listed properties, but can also have extras.

    ❌ Off: Item must exactly match only the listed properties.

## Exclude Negatives

You can add disqualifying properties that invalidate an item match if present.

Typical examples:

    "Brittle"

    "Cursed"

    "Antique"

If any of these are found on the item, the rule will not match.
## Filter by Rarity

You can restrict matches to items that include a specific rarity classification, such as:

    "Greater Artifact"

    "Legendary Artifact"

If the item doesn’t contain one of the selected rarities, it will not be highlighted.
## Equipment Slot Filtering

Each highlight rule can specify what equipment slots it is intended for:

    Helm, Gloves, Legs, Chest, Ring, Weapon, etc.

    Or a fallback “No Slot / Other” for miscellaneous items.

This ensures only applicable items are evaluated against a rule.

## Weight Filter

Rules can optionally exclude items that exceed a weight threshold, typically used to filter out cumbersome or penalizing items.

For example:

    "Disqualify if Weight ≥ 50"

## Configuration & UI
### In-Game Menu

Accessible via:

Options → Grid Highlight → Open Menu **or** Top-Right button on a grid container

Includes:

    Add / Remove Rules

    Edit Property Lists

    Import / Export settings

    Custom hue selectors

    Configurable match options

## Saving & Exporting

    Rules are stored in your Profile JSON (profile.json) for each character.

    You can export all highlights as a .json file.

    You can import previously saved configurations at any time.

## Custom Property Sets

The system supports configurable property categories, allowing compatibility with custom server property sets.

Editable categories:

    Regular stats (e.g. "Hit Chance Increase")

    Slayers and Super Slayers

    Resistances

    Negatives

    Rarities

Matching Engine Logic

    If rule is not active for the slot, skip.

    If item contains excluded negatives, reject.

    If item is missing required rarity, reject.

    If Accept Extra Properties is false`, perform strict comparison:

        Must contain only and all listed properties.

    If Accept Extra Properties is true, soft comparison:

        Must contain all required properties, others allowed.

## Example Use Case:
```json
[
    {
      "name": "Weapon",
      "hue": 180,
      "properties": [
        {
          "name": "Hit Mana Leech",
          "min_value": 75,
          "is_optional": false
        },
        {
          "name": "Hit Stamina Leech",
          "min_value": 50,
          "is_optional": false
        },
        {
          "name": "Hit Lower Defense",
          "min_value": 50,
          "is_optional": false
        },
        {
          "name": "Damage Increase",
          "min_value": 40,
          "is_optional": false
        }
      ],
      "accept_extra_properties": true,
      "minimum_property": 0,
      "exclude_negatives": [
        "Antique",
        "Brittle",
        "Cursed"
      ],
      "required_rarities": [],
      "grid_highlight_slot": {
        "talisman": false,
        "right_hand": true,
        "left_hand": true,
        "head": false,
        "earring": false,
        "neck": false,
        "chest": false,
        "shirt": false,
        "back": false,
        "robe": false,
        "arms": false,
        "hands": false,
        "bracelet": false,
        "ring": false,
        "belt": false,
        "skirt": false,
        "legs": false,
        "footwear": false
      }
    }
]
```
## Tips

    Use high-contrast hues like 27 (orange), 82 (green), or 40 (blue) for easy spotting.

    Export your config frequently when experimenting with new loot templates.

    Use the "Other / No Slot" checkbox for scrolls, runes, or rare objects without equipment slots.
