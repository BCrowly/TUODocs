## Spell Icons
We've added the ability to scale these icons and add matching hotkey text if desired

To get the hotkey to show up your marco name must be the spell name exactly, an easy way to do this would be to enable `Combat-Spells -> Enable Fast Spells Assign`. This allows you to hold `Ctrl + Alt` and left click a spell icon to quickly set up a macro for that spell, automatically naming it correctly.

## Health indicator
TazUO added a health indicator that will show a red border based on your health loss

## Quick item drop
If you hold Ctrl and drop an item anywhere in the game window it will attempt to drop it near your feet.
