This feature allows you to customize your tooltips exactly how you'd like to see them.

# Tooltip menu
Accessed via `Options -> TazUO -> Tooltips -> Tooltip override settings`

### A little explanation of the menu:  

The first text box is the search text, properties containing this text will be replace with the second text box  
:::note[You can optionally use regex by prefacing your search text with $: `$(Bless\b)` for example.  ]
:::

### The second box can use the following commands:  
-  `/c[red]` or `/c[#ffffff]` to set the color  
-  `/cd` to return to normal color.  
-  `/n` will add a blank line  
-  `{1}` will insert the first number found in the property  
-  `{2}` will insert the second number  
-  `{3}` will insert the original property line  

-  `4 and 5` are special, when using item comparisons (press `ctrl` while hovering over an item in your grid container to compare it to item equipped in that slot) these will be the difference between the values of that property.  
-  `{4}` the difference between the first numbers  
-  `{5}` the difference between the second numbers  

The next few boxes are for min and max values (for properties with numbers like Weapon Damage 10 - 15).

The final drop down box is to match specific item layers (If you wanted to set up one Mana increase for armor, and one for jewelry for example)

## Value difference comparisons

In this screenshot you can see there are numerical differences on the item in my inventory compared to the item equipped, this is done using the following formatting in tooltip overrides: `{0} /c[orange]{1}{4} /cd- /c[red]{2}{5}`  
Take special note of the `{4}` and `{5}`, which in this example are `-4` and `-3` (each value compared to the equipped item)


## Info
:::note[The textboxes don't work very well with long texts, it's recommended to edit your text outside and paste it into the box if there's not enough space in the box.]
:::

:::note[Properties and overrides are processed from top to bottom, so for certain things like Spell Damage Increase and Damage Increase you would want Spell Damage Increase *higher* on your list than Damage Increase.]
:::

:::note[If you want to edit properties outside of the game, using the **Export** button and then using a semi-visual editor such as https://jsoneditoronline.org/ works well.]
:::

:::note[Certain gumps like Vendor Search do not give the client item serials/data, the only tell the client what images to show and what tooltips to show, so only your overrides with the `ANY` layer will be applied to them because we don't know what layer the item is.]
