Hey there server owner, if you are interested in utilizing the Global Chat tab of the journal without breaking your current global chat system I would like to introduce you to the chat packet, it's a very easy modification of your current global chat system( usually used with `[c` ).

Most chat systems today use a simple `mobile.SendMessage(FormattedMessageString)`, but that can be swapped out for some iteration of this:  
```csharp
foreach (Server.Network.NetState ns in Server.Network.NetState.Instances)
    if (ns.Mobile != null)
    {
        ns.Mobile.Send(new Server.Engines.Chat.ChatMessagePacket(e.Mobile, 57, "0" + e.Mobile.Name, "THIS IS A TEST.")); //The 0 is a color code that's non functional but required
    }
```

This will send the client a chat packet, which by default shows in the system chat the same as mobile.SendMessage does, but it also allows the client to process it as a chat message including CUO utilizing the Chat Message Hue, and for TazUO utilizing the separate journal tab:

It's also simple to change the formatting, the default `,` chat command sends the name portion of that packet as `<serial>PlayerName`, but using the above packet method I showed you can omit the serial if that is not desired.
