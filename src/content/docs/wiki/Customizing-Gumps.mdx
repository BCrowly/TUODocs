description: Starting with version v3.

Starting with version v3.15.0, you can customize **some** gumps look and feel via JSON files inside `Data/UI/`  

The gumps available for customization will generate json files for them **when they are opened in game for the first time**.

Not everything is customizable, but anything that is will be added to them, most commonly graphics and hues(colors).
