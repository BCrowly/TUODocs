## Manual installation

<details>
<summary>Migrate from a CUO installation (Keep your settings and profile data) (Click here)</summary>  

### Installation is easy:

:::note[If you used the updater to install TUO, skip to **step 3**]
:::

1. Downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/bittiez/TazUO/releases/latest)  

       You need the TazUO.zip file from that release.

2. Create a folder where you want TUO installed, for example `Documents/TazUO`

3. Unzip the `ClassicUO.zip` file you downloaded in `step 1` into the folder you created in `step 2`

4. Copy your old `settings.json` and `/Data/` folder from your **old CUO** install into your new directory
```bash
These can usually be found under ClassicUO/ClassicUO/
            You can right click the ClassicUO shortcut on your desktop and hit "Open file location" for easier access.
       
       You may need to edit settings.json and update your ultimaonlinedirectory location.

       You can skip this step(3) if you don't want your old settings and profiles(macros/gumps/spell bars/etc) copied over.
```  

5. Run ClassicUO.exe in your new directory!


Your finished directory should look something like this(with a few more files than this):

1. Follow the steps above, skipping `step 3`. 

2. Run ClassicUO.exe once, it will create a `settings.json` file that you will need to populate with your UO directory, server info and optional assistant.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Editing settings.json</summary>

1. Open your TazUO folder

<Code code="If you used the updater, open the TUO folder inside your TazUO folder." lang="bash" />

2. Locate and open `settings.json`, you can use notepad or notepad++.

3. Editing important settings  
3.1 Shard ip and port  
        Find and edit these lines as needed for your specific shard, their website should list their IP and PORT
```json
"ip": "login.shardaddress.com",
  "port": 2593,
``` 

3.2 Ultima online installation directory  
        Find and edit this line as needed for where you have Ultima Online installed (Not CUO or TazUO, your install from EA)
```json
"ultimaonlinedirectory": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Electronic Arts\\Ultima Online Classic",
```

<details>
<summary>Are you planning on using an assistant such as Razor Enhanced or Classic Assist?</summary>

In the TazUO folder go to data. In that folder should be a folder named plugins. Drop your preferred client assistant, ex Razor Enhanced. 

**Find and locate this line**
```json
"plugins": [
  ]
```bash
**If you are using Razor Enhanced**
```json
"plugins": [
    "Razor\\RazorEnhanced.exe"
  ]
```bash
**If you are using Classic Assist**
```json
"plugins": [
    "ClassicAssist\\ClassicAssist.dll"
  ]
```
