This feature is a work in progress, but for now *most* gumps can be locked by `Ctrl + Alt + Left click` on the gump, this will lock it in place, and disable moving of the gump until unlocked via the same method.

### Notes
* This may not work with certain gumps  
* This will not transfer over with profile overrides
* This does not work on anchored gumps


# `Ctrl + Alt + Mouse wheel` opacity adjustment
This feature will adjust the opacity for most gumps in game, and will save for most gumps that can be saved between sessions.

### Notes
* This is not a perfect solution, there are certain things that may look bad with lower opacity, or some gumps that don't respond to this such as the world map.
