This is a simple guide to teach you how you can run different settings files with one TUO install

❓ **Could you explain that like I'm 5?**  
If you play with different clients(multiple servers), or run multiple accounts on the same server you can make a simple shortcut to open that specific client, or to have that account/password pre-typed in when you run TUO from a specific shortcut.

## Instructions
:::note[This guide assumes you are using Windows]
:::

###  Step 1
Open your TUO directory and locate `settings.json`

### Step 2
Create a copy of that file in the same directory, you could name it `acct2.json`  
▶️ Open this file in notepad, or use https://jsoneditoronline.org/ to edit this file as needed. (To change account, uo directory, server info, etc)

### Step 3
Create a shortcut of `ClassicUO.exe`  
▶️ You can right-click that file -> Send to -> Desktop to easily create a shortcut  

### Step 4
-Right-click your new shortcut and go to Properties  
-Scroll to the end of the `Target` field  
-Add ` -settings acct2.json` to that line so it looks similar to this:
