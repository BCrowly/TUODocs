Discord has release what they call the Social SDK.  

You can completely ignore all these by simply not logging into discord.  

Right now we have implemented via discord:  

- DM's to friends from in-game
- Messaging your server you are playing on using TazUO
- Messaging all players using TazUO

Please note, this is all done via discord, not your server. Server owners have no control of this feature, if you need assistance please use our discord.  

DM's are only between you and your friend, no one else can see them.  

Server messaging is only for players using TazUO and logged into discord.

TazUO Global is only seen from players with TazUO and logged into discord.
