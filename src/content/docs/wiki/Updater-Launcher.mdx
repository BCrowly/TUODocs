We have created a separate launcher for TazUO, it's very easy to use:  
[Download](https://github.com/bittiez/TUO-Launcher/releases/latest)

## Installation
:::note[This will work best if you do this in a new directory, such as `C:/Program Files/TazUO/`]
:::

* Unzip the launcher files into a directory, anywhere you want.  
* Run `TazUO Launcher.exe` or `TazUO Launcher` if you're on unix.    
* The launcher will automatically download the most recent version of TazUO and install it in the same directory.

<summary>Mac</summary>
The install can be a bit of a pain.

You will need to run the launcher, mac will tell you it didn't open it.  

Go to `Settings -> Privacy and Security` -> Scroll to the bottom and click Allow. 

This will happen several times, for each dylib file unfortunately, but when it's all set up it will save you time with UO configurations.

:::note[The file structure will look like this after running the launcher]
:::
```bash
/TazUO Launcher.exe
/TazUO/ Files here
```
