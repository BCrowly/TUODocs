CUO and TazUO have commands separate from the common server `[commands`, by using `-` as the deliminator.

## `-cast spellname`
You can type <Code code="-cast teleport" lang="bash" /> to attempt to cast that spell quickly, works with all standard spells (This will not work for servers with custom spells)

## `-skill skillname`
You can type <Code code="-skill remove t" lang="bash" /> to use the remove trap skill, this will match the first skill with that text in it's name, so if it uses the wrong skill try using the full skill name.
