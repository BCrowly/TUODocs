It should be fairly self-explanatory how this works but I will cover it in detail in case you've got any questions:
* The **X** button will delete that cool bar condition
* Hue is the cool down bar color
* Label is the text that will appear on the cool down bar
* Cool down is the duration in **seconds**
* You have the option to of `All, Other, Self` to choose, this is who the message is coming from
* The preview button will create a cool down with your color and label so you can see it
* The save button will save any changes you've made to that cool down condition. **:warning:This is the only way to save a cool down condition:warning:**
