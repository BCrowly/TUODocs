Let's face it, if you enjoy treasure map hunting you are more than likely using one of the **many** options out there weather it be websites, RazerEnhanced, ClassicAssist, EasyUO, etc to help you determine the location of that map. If you aren't then don't read any further, continue to enjoy hunting maps the old fashioned way!  

## TazUO T-Map features:

We've simplified the process for you a little bit:

Where oh where could this map be? It's probably near Delucia if I had to guess, but let me double check before I venture off:

This will show you where the map should be, and if you are within pathfinding distance (Somewhere ~ 10-15 tiles) you can pathfind directly to it.

## SOS message features

We've added the same functionality (Minus the pathfinding) for SOS messages, simply open the message and if it's decoded properly you'll get a message with the coords and a right-click option to show you the location on the map.
