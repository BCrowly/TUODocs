Override sounds in game with your own mp3 files!  

## How do I use this?  
You will need to create a new director inside TUO:  
`/SoundOverrides/`  

Next figure out the ID of the sound you want to replace (This may prove difficult, UOFiddler can help)  

Now save your mp3 file under `/SoundOverrides/` as id.mp3(For example: 299.mp3)

Restart your client.

:::note[Note that most effects are interrupted mid play by other effects, so you are better off making sounds in the same duration as the original]
