Profiles now use a 3-way backup system to provide you the last three versions of your profile in-case something happens.

You will just need to go into your profile folder and rename the one desired back to profile.json.  

These are created every time you logout or anytime you close the options menu, so doing that 3 times with a bad profile will result in all three backups being bad.
