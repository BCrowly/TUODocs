This gump will show loot from all corpses within your auto-open corpse distance(Usually 2 tiles).  

-**This gump is controller friendly, use `dpad up/down` to navigate and `a` to loot the selected item.**  
-Your grid highlight settings also work here to help you easily see loot you desire.  


You can open it via the top menu -> More button **or** you can create a macro to toggle it open/closed.  


The purpose of this gump is to provide an easy way to see all nearby corpses in one window.  
You do not need to have auto open corpses enabled for this to work, it's up to you weather you want to leave it on or not.
